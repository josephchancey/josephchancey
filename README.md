### About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @josephchancey
- 🏫 I currrenty am enrolled at a CSU, and at a UC professional program for data analysis.
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and web app development for data analysis projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter DM or LinkedIn, please see links at bottom.
- 📜 I have almost completed my B.A. in History. Though History is my major, Computer Science was origianlly my dicipline when I entered college. I switched to history because I grew fond of the research and writing process. In university I completed Computer Programming I & II. I try my best to combine skills from both majors, which is why data analysis appeals to me so much. History/Computer-Science are incredibly useful in data analysis, as effectively synthesizing and comunicating information is a large part of the job.

### My History
- 🕹️ I have created games in Unity3D as a hobby since 2013.
- 📊 I have had two jobs that required extensive data management.
- 🌐 I previously worked as a web developer for a small RC hobby store. 

### My Current Prospects
- 🤔 I will be creating many Python data analaysis, data engineering, and data science repositories through the coming months.
- 🤖 I will also be exploring OpenAI use cases for data analytics.
