### About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @josephchancey
- 📜 I have almost completed my B.A. in History. Though History is my major, I am a computer nerd. Computer Science was origianlly my major, I switched to history because I grew fond of the research and writing process. In university I completed Computer Programming I & II. I try my best to combine skills from both majors. Which is incredibly useful with data analysis, as communication and research is a large part of the job.
- 🏫 I currrenty am enrolled at a CSU, and at a UC professional program for data analysis.
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, data science, and game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning unsupervised machine learning in Python for data science @ UC Davis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis/science projects professionally, and unity game dev projects as a hobby. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter DM or LinkedIn, see links at bottom of form.

### My History
- 🕹️ I have created games in Unity3D as a hobby since 2013.
- 📊 I have had two jobs that required extensive data management.
- 🌐 I previosuly worked as a full-stack web developer for a small RC hobby store. 

### My Current Prospects
- 🤔 I will be creating Python data analaysis/science repositories through the coming months. I will be updating this ReadME.md once I graduate my data analysis boot camp. By that time there will be many projects on my page.
- 💡 I will also be uploading my hobby Unity3D projects. I recently started hobbying in Blender, creating 'PS1 era' retro graphics.
- 🤖 I will also be exploring machine learning algorithms.
